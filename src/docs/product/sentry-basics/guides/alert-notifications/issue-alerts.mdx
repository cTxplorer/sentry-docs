Create and manage Issue Alerts by navigating to Alerts and clicking the "Alert Rules" tab where you'll see a list of all active rules and can add new rules or modify existing ones. Select your project and choose Issue Alert. Sentry users with admin permissions or higher can create alerts.

## Step 1: Choose an Environment
Specify which environment(s) will use this particular alert rule. `Environment` is a Sentry supported tag that you can (and should) add to your SDK. Generally, the tag accepts any value but is targeted to refer to the naming convention of your code deployments such as -- _Development_, _Testing_, _Staging_, _Production_, etc. This enables various features and filtering capabilities within your Sentry account.

When creating a new alert rule, select the environment in which you want the rule applied. The environment drop-down list is populated with the 'environment' tag values available in your Event Stream.

This will allow you to refine your rules based on the environment where your project errors originated. This is quite useful, as the urgency and workflows you apply to **Production** alerts might differ from the ones you apply to alerts originating from your **QA** environment.

## Step 2: Give the Alert Rule a Name
Manage your alert rules by giving it a descriptive name.

## Step 3: Set Conditions
Conditions rely on event [tags](#event-tags), [attribute](#event-attributes) values, [event frequency](#event-frequency), and [issue state](#issue-state-changes) changes. Conditions are evaluated for an issue alert **each time** Sentry receives a new event, subject to [rate limits](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/#rate-limit). Customize your alerts by setting conditions for notifying the most necessary project team members. Define who to notify, about what erorr, when and how, making sure errors are getting the appropriate attention from the relevant audience.

Alert conditions have three parts:

- ("When...") [Triggers](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/#triggers) specify what type of activity you'd like monitored.
- ("If...") [Filters](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/#filters) help control noise by filtering down the triggered alerts to ony those matching specific criteria.
- ("Then...") [Actions](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/#actions) specify what should happen (where you'd like to channel this alert) when the alert is triggered and passes the filters.

### Event Tags

Tags are key-value pairs that Sentry assigns to each event. Some of the tags are added by default, depending on the platform and type of SDK. Developers can also add **Custom Tags** through the SDK. You can find the list of tags available in your project under **Settings > [organization] > [project] > Tags**. The list is an aggregation of all of the tag keys (default and custom) that have been encountered in events in this project.

Event tags are useful for various reasons. First, tags are indexed and this allows you to query your errors in the Sentry `Event Stream` and `Issue Stream` based on specific tag values. In addition, adding the right tags in your code will allow you to tell Sentry to notify you only when events with specific details occur.

To create a rule based on a tag's value, select the condition

```
An event's tags match {key} {match} {value}
```

A tag-based condition can be used as the sole condition for an alert rule or in conjunction with additional conditions to fine tune the rule:

> In this rule, we're leveraging custom tags that our developers added through the Sentry SDK, telling Sentry to notify us via our _#sentry-urgent_ **Slack** channel when _Enterprise_ customers are experiencing errors in critical parts of our application.

### Event Attributes

The alert rule system in Sentry is capable of picking out attributes from an event's payload. There are 15 different kinds of attributes that a rule can target. Those include attributes like `Error Message`, `Error Type`, the `Platform`, `user.id`, `http.method`, `stacktrace.filename`, and others.

To set an attribute-based condition in your rule, select the condition:

```
An event's {attribute} value {match} {value}
```

> In this example, any event with type “SubscriptionError” indicating an error in the billing flow will be routed directly to PagerDuty for our on-call engineer to handle.

You can also set up rules that account for multiple different attributes at once, and chain that logic together.

> In this more advanced example, a notification containing the message, platform, and type attribute values gets routed to the _Android Dev_ team in _Slack_ if a _RunTimeError_ with the message _Failed to Reload Index_ comes in from our _Java platform_.

### Event Frequency

It’s often necessary to create a rule based on a frequency threshold to help determine the significance of an error’s impact and escalation priority. Among other use-cases, threshold conditions can be set in conjunction with tag and attribute based conditions to indicate a spike in errors in a certain environment, release, or page in your app or package in your code.

Sentry provides two threshold conditions based either on the event occurrence or number of affected users:

```
An issue is seen more than {value} times in {frequency}
An issue is seen by more than {value} users in {frequency}
```

### Issue State Changes

Every Issue in Sentry has a defined state - _Unresolved_, _Resolved_, or _Ignored_. Read about [Issue States](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#issue-states) for more information.

#### Regression Alert

When Sentry captures new event instances of an issue previously marked as _Resolved_, it will change the issue state back to _Unresolved_. By default, Sentry will apply the regression workflow and notify all project team members about the **Regression** through email. However, when it comes to regressions, you may want to put specific notifications in-place. To set up a regression rule, use the condition "An issue changes state from resolved to unresolved."

![Regression Alert Rules](alerts_notifications_06.png)

> For instance, set-up two regression alert rules to
>
> - Notify your on-call personal via **PagerDuty** when a regression is identified in your **production environment**.
> - Notify your engineering team via a **Slack** channel when a regression is identified in **any environment.**

#### Unresolved Issue Reminder

Sentry users can choose to ignore specific issues in their issue stream for a defined number of users, time thresholds, or occurrences.

![Ignore Issues](alerts_notifications_07.png)

To set up a reminder that a previously **Ignored** issue has become **Unresolved** again, use the condition "An issue changes state from ignored to unresolved
."

> In this rule, we're sending a "reminder" alert via **Slack** to a _#sentry-backlog_ channel and a direct message to the project manager _@neil_.

## Step 4: Set a Rate Limit
The rate limit controls how often the alert rule can be triggered for a particular issue. The rate limit is set to perform the action according to one of these intervals:

- minutes: 5, 10, 30, 60
- hours: 3, 12, 24
- one week or 30 days

## Step 5: Finalize the Alert Rule
Click "Create Alert Rule".
