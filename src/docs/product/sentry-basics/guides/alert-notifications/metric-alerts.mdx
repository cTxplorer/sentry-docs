Create and manage Metric Alerts by navigating to Alerts and clicking the "Alert Rules" tab where you'll see a list of all active rules and can add new rules or modify existing ones. Sentry users with admin permissions or higher can create alerts.

## Step 1. Choose Errors or Transactions

In the Alert Conditions section, choose between Errors or Transactions. Errors provide data around a break, such as new issues or total errors in your project. Transactions provide data on the performance of your application, such as [latency](/product/performance/metrics/#latency) and [failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate).

## Step 2: Choose a Metric

Errors and Transactions each have different metrics for alerting.

### Error Metrics for Alerting
- `count()`
- `count_unique(...)`

### Transaction Metrics for Alerting
- `avg(...)`
- `percentile(...)`
- `failure_rate()`
- `apdex(...)`
- `count()`
- `p50()`
- `p75()`
- `p95()`
- `p99()`
- `p100()`

## Step 3: Choose a Time Window

Decide how often you want your metric evaluated. Your choices are 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours.

## Step 4: Choose an Environment

Specify which environment(s) will use this particular alert rule. `Environment` is a Sentry supported tag that you can (and should) add to your SDK. Generally, the tag accepts any value but is targeted to refer to the naming convention of your code deployments such as -- _Development_, _Testing_, _Staging_, _Production_, etc. This enables various features and filtering capabilities within your Sentry account.

When creating a new alert rule, select the environment in which you want the rule applied. The environment drop-down list is populated with the 'environment' tag values available in your Event Stream.

This will allow you to refine your rules based on the environment where your project errors originated. This is quite useful, as the urgency and workflows you apply to **Production** alerts might differ from the ones you apply to alerts originating from your **QA** environment.

## Step 5: Set a Threshold

Thresholds are numerical values that help define an alert trigger. The Warning trigger's threshold must be breached before the Critical trigger. Triggers are evaluated approximately every minute from the highest severity to lowest.

## Step 6: Set an Action

Action define how you'll be alerted. Possible actions are:

- Send an email (to a member or team). If sent to a member, the member's personal project alert opt-out settings are overridden.
- Send a [Slack](/product/integrations/slack/) notification.
- Trigger a [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/pagerduty/) incident.
- Send a request to a webhook (via [internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations)).

## Step 7: Give the Alert Rule a Name

Manage your alert rules by giving it a descriptive name.

## Step 8: Save the Rule

Click "Save Rule".
